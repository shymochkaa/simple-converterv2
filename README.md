# Metric/Imperial Unit Conversion

This project is a simple tool for converting units between Metric and Imperial systems. It was created as part of **Frontend Developer Career Path** on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) to practice fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The tool can handle length, volume, and mass conversions quickly and easily.

- Convert masses (kilograms to pounds and vice versa)
- User-friendly interface with an input field and conversion button

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

2. Enter a numeric value in the input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the conversions for length, volume, and mass displayed below the input field.

### Example Conversion
For an input of **20**:
- Length: `20 meters = 65.616 feet | 20 feet = 6.096 meters`
- Volume: `20 liters = 5.284 gallons | 20 gallons = 75.708 liters`
- Mass: `20 kilos = 44.092 pounds | 20 pounds = 9.072 kilos`
